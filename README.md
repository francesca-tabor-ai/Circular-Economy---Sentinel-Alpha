# Sentinel Alpha

Sentinel Alpha exists for one reason: To help organizations see circular economy risks and opportunities forming before they become obvious.

In the transition to a circular economy, information is abundant — but true early warning is rare. Most signals only become visible once resource constraints tighten, supply chains break, and circular models are already being disrupted. By that point, adaptation is expensive, transitions are rushed, and value is lost.

We built Sentinel Alpha to change that timing.

## What We Do

Sentinel Alpha delivers proprietary circular economy intelligence to organizations committed to the transition.

Our technology continuously analyses structural signals across resource flows, material cycles, value circulation networks, and circular infrastructure dependencies — translating complex multi-domain data into clear, actionable early-warning intelligence for circular economy transitions.

- ✕ Not a data terminal.
- ✕ Not a research shop.
- ✕ Not an alternative data vendor.

## Why We Exist

The greatest losses in circular economy transitions rarely come from being wrong about direction. They come from being exposed when resource systems themselves become unstable.

History shows that circular economy disruptions build quietly, accelerate suddenly, and become obvious only after value circulation breaks down.

**"Our mission is to move detection earlier — when circular transitions are still possible and resource flows still exist."**

## Who We Serve

- **Circular Economy Organizations**  
  Committed to resource circulation and value preservation.

- **Sustainability Leaders**  
  Transitioning to circular business models.

- **Resource System Managers**  
  With significant circular economy exposure.

*We intentionally maintain a limited client base to preserve signal integrity and information advantage in circular economy intelligence.*

## Our Philosophy

- **Clarity over noise**  
  Fewer signals. Higher conviction. Clear interpretation.

- **Speed over volume**  
  Earlier insight matters more than more data.

- **Trust over scale**  
  We prioritise deep, long-term partnerships.

- **Edge is earned**  
  True advantage comes from proprietary intelligence.

## Our Approach

- Resource flow and material cycle monitoring
- Circular value network fragility detection
- Circular economy transition shift analysis
- Event cascade modelling across resource systems

## Long-Term Vision

To become the trusted early-warning intelligence layer that the world's most sophisticated circular economy organizations check before sizing circular economy risk and opportunity.
